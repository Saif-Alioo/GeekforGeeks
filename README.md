<h1>1:Array Pair Sum Divisibility Problem</h1>
<h3>Given an array of integers nums and a number k, write a function that returns true if given array can be divided into pairs such that sum of every pair is divisible by k.</h3>
<h3>Example:
nums = [9, 5, 7, 3]
k = 6
Output: 
True
Explanation: 
{(9, 3), (5, 7)} is a 
possible solution. 9 + 3 = 12 is divisible
by 6 and 7 + 5 = 12 is also divisible by 6.

<h1>2:Reverse First K elements of Queue</h1>
<h3>Given an integer K and a queue of integers, we need to reverse the order of the first K elements of the queue, leaving the other elements in the same relative order.

Only following standard operations are allowed on queue.

->enqueue(x) : Add an item x to rear of queue
->equeue() : Remove an item from front of queue
->size() : Returns number of elements in queue.
->front() : Finds front item.
<h5>Note</h5>: The above operations represent the general processings. In-built functions of the respective languages can be used to solve the problem.</h3>
<h3>Example:
5 3
1 2 3 4 5
Output: 
3 2 1 4 5
Explanation: 
After reversing the given
input from the 3rd position the resultant
output will be 3 2 1 4 5.

<h1>3:Insertion Sort for Singly Linked List</h1>
<h3>Given a singly linked list, sort the list (in ascending order) using insertion sort algorithm..</h3>
<h3>Example:
Input:
N = 10
Linked List = 30->23->28->30->11->14->
              19->16->21->25 
Output : 
11 14 16 19 21 23 25 28 30 30 
Explanation :
The resultant linked list is sorted.

<h1>4:Find duplicate rows in a binary matrix</h1>
<h3>Given a boolean matrix of size RxC where each cell contains either 0 or 1, find the row numbers (0-based) of row which already exists or are repeated.</h3>
<h3>Example:
nput:
R = 2, C = 2
matrix[][] = {{1, 0},
            {1, 0}}
Output: 
1
Explanation:
Row 1 is duplicate of Row 0.

<h1>5:Leaders in an array</h1>
<h3>Given an array A of positive integers. Your task is to find the leaders in the array. An element of array is a leader if it is greater than or equal to all the elements to its right side. The rightmost element is always a leader. </h3>
<h3>Example:
Input
n = 6
A[] = {16,17,4,3,5,2}
Output: 17 5 2
Explanation: The first leader is 17 
as it is greater than all the elements
to its right.  Similarly, the next 
leader is 5. The right most element 
is always a leader so it is also 
included.

<h1>Zero Sum Subarray</h1>
<h3>You are given an array arr[] of size n. Find the total count of sub-arrays having their sum equal to 0.</h3>
<h3>Example:</h3>
<h4>Input:
n = 6
arr[] = {0,0,5,5,0,0}
Output: 6
Explanation: The 6 subarrays are 
[0], [0], [0], [0], [0,0], and [0,0].</h4>
